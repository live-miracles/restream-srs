// Same SGR color codes SRS's own console output uses, and that the dashboard's
// log viewer (public/ts/features/editor.ts, ANSI_FG_CLASS) already parses into
// color for every journal tail it renders — including our own
// restream-srs.service tail. Applied unconditionally, not gated on isTTY: the

// web parser, neither of which cares that stdout here is a pipe to journald
// rather than a tty.
